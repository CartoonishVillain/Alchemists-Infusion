A mod by jedijoe to make effects more viable

Supermegazord567 - guinea pig for testing before I launch updates

Blusunrize and the immersive engineering team - Their code has taught me a lot and I use small, modified snippits of it. Thanks to their neat license  

Mojang - A lot of textures are just modified versions of their base textures. It'd be rude not to credit them.

Forge team - I am using their huge modding api, after all.
